## Problem Identification

The team are not utilising GitLab issues to the extent at which they can help them plan and organise their work. This is backed up by the fundamental lack of team organisation when it comes to assigning workload among the team. The issues that have been created on the GitLab share the same issues that are apparent in the group discussions where they represent larger story points that "we" (as a team) need to complete. If the team does not plan out their objectives and split them amongst the team, the workload will continue to be disproportionately split among members, with some members not having a task that they need to get done. As can be seen in [Issue #36](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/team-project-h/2024/sh17/sh17-main/-/issues/36), the team is willing to use the issue tracker, but by not using the assigning capabilities, contributions may become uneven. This further exacerbates the issue of some team members not engaging in group discussions and being relegated to back-bench tasks like taking meeting notes, with little input on how they feel about their contribution.

**Objectives:**

1. Communicate the importance of accountability, and how assigning story points/tasks to people using GitLab can allow people to more easily discuss what they work on.
2. Increase the use of the issue tracker to aid the team in project planning.
3. Spread the workload across the team.

## Description and Justification of PIA

The plan will be to present examples of good project planning through showing examples of issues, having the team discuss the requirements of these issues, and then assigning them to each other in a mock stand-up. This will directly address the concerns by not only demonstrating to the team the value of creating issues but, more importantly, the importance of discussing them among team members about how they can be best addressed. Since the team has a customer day coming up, we will follow up on this by discussing their sprint plan under the same banner, in the hope that the team will use a similar process in creating/assigning issues on the GitLab.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

**Materials:**
- A list of example issues for the team to discuss, tied to a similar mock-project that shares characteristics with their project.
- A survey before and after the exercise to collate understanding and perception of the issue tracker preceding and following the warmup exercise.

**Metrics to Measure:**
- Quantitative:
  - Number of issues created after Sprint Day.
  - Number of issues assigned after the sprint.
  - Number of interactions (comments) on issues.
- Qualitative:
  - Feedback from the team during planning and retrospective exercises.
  - Qualitative and quantitative data from feedback surveys, compared to their baseline levels measured in a similar survey beforehand.

**Measurement Plan:**
- Issues Created:
  - Following the Sprint Day (6/11/24), all new issues created will be tracked, and up to the end of the preceding week (15/11/24), the state of the issues in terms of comments, assignments, and other interactions will be measured and documented.
  - $N$ Issues
  - $N_A$ Assigned Issues
  - $N_C$ Number of Issues with comments/interactions
- When:
  - Issues can be consistently measured as their histories will be stored on GitLab.
  - Feedback and qualitative data will be collected during team meetings on 13/11/24.

**Risks and Mitigation:**
The team aren't familiar with using a project planning tool when coding, so I will talk the team through examples and lead a discussion on my experience as a software engineer in the industry, and motivate how and why we use these issues.

## Implementation Report

For this exercise, a short presentation of the motivation for the exercise was conducted beforehand, followed by the preliminary survey, the seven example issues, and the concluding survey.

The two surveys were completed without issue, but the team clearly didn't enjoy them as much, sighing when informed there was a second one. Additionally, some of the questions did not merit the results that I had expected, but those results will still be reported below:

Questions 2, 3, 4 were all completed correctly, but question 4 was subsequently completed incorrectly following the fact. I followed up with the team afterwards and cleared up the confusion; they had misread the question the second time around.

While the list of issues produced created a dynamic discussion with the team, some of the issues did not create the discussion I expected. For example, Issue 2 was expected to be "too complex" for a single issue, but the team discussed it positively and treated it like an "epic," which they could split up into tasks.

Similar diverted discussions occurred for issues 4 and 5, but these issues still sparked discussion among team members, and I was impressed by how well the team discussed sharing the workload.

The evaluations were completed on the 11th of November during week 6, preceding the team's second customer meeting.

## Results

**Results from Issue Tracker:**

- Baseline:
  - There have currently been $N = 5$ issues created outside of the required ones.
  - With $N_A$ being 0 at the time of the exercise.
  - With $N_C$ being 2, with both issues having a single comment.

- Post-Exercise:
  - 15 $N = 15$ issues were created, 9 of which were assigned to a team member $N_A = 9$, however, only 2 of the issues received comments.
  - The team also assigned "labels" to each issue, which was discussed in the PIA.
  - Issues have also been linked together on GitLab.

**Survey Results:**

- Survey 1: [Link to Preliminary Results]
- Survey 2: [Link to Follow-Up Results]

## Critical Assessment

Overall, the workload increase following the sprint meeting will have increased the number of issues required. I do believe that my discussion and PIA with the team has helped them utilise the issue tracker more effectively. The team's confidence in the tracker markedly increased, as seen in the survey questions. Additionally, the quality and quantity of issues increased following the PIA, but the most significant change was in the team's discussion of issues and using the assignment feature.

## Future Process Improvement Activity

**Recommendation:** Introduce a sample **collaborative sprint-planning session** where the team creates, discusses, and assigns GitLab issues together.

**Justification:**
The PIA highlighted that while the team improved issue creation and assignment, engagement with comments and consistent use of GitLab remained limited. A weekly sprint-planning session will directly address this by fostering teamwork and reinforcing structured discussions on tasks.
