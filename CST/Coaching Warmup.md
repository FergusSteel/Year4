# Introduction to Issue Tracking

- **Why Are We Here?**
  - To explore and improve how we organize, assign, and track tasks within GitLab.
  - GitLab issues can make it easier to track workload, distribute tasks more fairly, and improve team collaboration.

# Motivation

- **Current Challenges**
  - Lack of clear task assignments leads to uneven workloads.
  - Broad, unassigned issues create ambiguity and missed opportunities for contribution.

- **Why It Matters**
  - Effective issue tracking supports better project management.
  - Clear responsibilities lead to balanced work distribution and accountability.
  - Assigning tasks helps everyone know their role and what each other are working on
