Opportunity:
The team are not utilising GitLab issues to the extent at which they can help them plan an organise they're work. This is backed up by the fundamental lack of team organisation when it comes to assigning work load among the team. The issues that have been created on the GitLab share the same issues that are apparent in the group discussions where they represent larger story points that "we" (as a team) need to complete. If the team does not plan out their objective and split them amongst the team, the workload will continue to be disproportionally split among members - with some members not having a task that they need to get done. As can be seen in [Issue #36](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/team-project-h/2024/sh17/sh17-main/-/issues/36) the team is willing to use the issue tracker, but by not using the assigning capabilities I think the contributions may become uneven, further exasperating the issue that I have noticed where some of the team members do not engage in group discussions, and are relegated to back-bench tasks like taking meeting notes with little input on how they feel about their contribution.

Objectives:
1. Communicate the importance of accountability, and how by assigning story points / tasks to people using GitLab, can allow people to more easily discuss what they work on.
2. Increase the use of the issue tracker to aid the team in project planning
3. Spread the workload across the team.

Exercise:
The plan will be to present examples of good project planning - through showing examples of issues, having the team discuss the requirements of these issues, and then assigning them to each other in a mock stand-up.
This will directly address the concerns by not only demonstrating to the team the value of creating issues, but more importantly the importance of discussing them among team members about how they can be best addressed.
Since the team, has a customer day coming up, we will follow up on this by discussing their sprint plan under the same banner, in the hope that the team will use a similar process in creating/assigning issues on the GitLab.

Materials:
A list of example issues, for the team to discuss - tied to a similiar mock-project that shares characteristics with their project. 
	Additionally a survey to collate understanding and perception of the issue tracker preceding and following the warmup exercise.

Metrics to Measure:
- Quantitative:
      - Number of Issues created after Sprint Day
            - An increase in the number of issues that are descriptive and relevant will show the adoption of the team using GitLab
      - Number of Issues Assigned after the sprint
            - Assigning the issues to distribute the workflow among the team is important and if the team take-up this practice it will demonstrate 
      - Number of interactions (comments) on issues
- Qualitative
      - Some thematic analysis of any discussion on important issues (be that in teams channel or on the issues comments)
      - Feedback on the team from sprint-planning and retrospective exercises.
- Qualitative and Quantitaive data from feedback survey, compared to their baseline levels measured in similiar survey before hand

Measurement Plan:
- Issues Created:
      - Following the Sprint Day (6/11/24) all new issues created will be tracked, and up to the end of the preceeding week (15/11/24) the state of the issues in terms of comments, assignments and other interactions will be measured and documented.
      - $N$ Issues
      - $N_A$ Assigned Issues
      - $N_C$ Number of Issues with comments/Interactions
      - $\epsilon$ The amount of orphaned issues, issues that are created but never assigned or interacted with.
- Baseline:
      - There have currently been $N = 5$ issues created outside of the required ones.
      - With $N_A$ being 0 at time of exercise
      - With $N_C$ being 2, with both issues having a single comment - both discussing why issue was close (example of good use so far)
- When?
      - Issues can be consistently measured as their histories will be stored on the GitLab
      - Feedback and Qualitative data will be collected during team meeting during next meeting (13/11/24)

Risks and Mitigation
The team aren't familiar with using a project planning tool when coding, so I will talk team through examples and lead a discussion on my experience as a software engineer in industry and motivate how and why we use these issues.
