For feature validation use UNET for input reconstruction to validate system has emebedde the relevant entropy of inputs - ifthis doesnt work somethings wrong.

Explcitly the actual rate of change in the signals is correlated to the change in the visual domain, we are learning this pattern/texture of audio features

Audio events are by definition correlated to video features more than the audio's changing frequencies. 

Consider LSTMs as a minimal fall back system

For next week show feature extraction + validation.
