**Review**

This paper investigates how students in work-based learning programs develop professional competencies during industry placements. Using established frameworks like the UK standard for accrediting Inc. Engineers (UK-Spec), it shows the need to integrate the development of these competencies into degree curriculum via work-based approaches to prepare students for work in  tech.

While the framework for identifying professional competencies is well established. This paper seeks to discuss _how_ & which professional competencies are developed when students undertake industry placements. The paper touches on the validity of the frameworks & their rationales through referencing other research into professional skills development. Approaching the problem from an angle of qualitative understanding of  student experience isn't a novel method for investigating the process by which students identify their own development of professional skills. However, framing it under a previously unstudied framework , is an important new angle to explore. Furthering the understanding of how to adapt work-based placements for training professionals.

This paper focuses on literature relevant to developing professional competencies in computing science. Referencing several pieces of literature about work-based learning and general professional skills development in competency-based computing curriculum. Using well established frameworks from reputable sources to discuss curriculum development (IT2017, CC2020) & for defining professional skills (UK-Spec). The paper uses evidence to motivate its methodology & justify the limitations of self-reported data, by referencing papers that use self-reported student experiences in computing literature. The paper also uses thorough citations to support the discussion of the results & to motivate future work.

The paper identifies the limitations of using one cohort and self-reported data. Surveying a single cohort is justifiable given the large sample size, and while self-reported data contains biases (e.g., students may misidentify characteristics), this is reduced by requiring peer-reviewed evidence from managers and instructors. To aid the depth of the research, students could have been asked to provide evidence for why they felt they **did not** develop certain competencies. This would increase the quantity of data collected, adding to the external validity, and it would also add valuable insight into understanding how certain competencies are developed and why other competencies are not developed.

The investigation is well presented and easy to follow, the codes used to identify professional competencies clearly explained. The quotes used in the results section are well selected and aid the discussion naturally.

This paper presents an insightful investigation into how professional competencies develop in students. Using a qualitative approach based on a established framework, the conclusions of how the cohort of students developed the outlined skills are valid and helpful in developing the current understanding of how work-based curriculums aid in equipping software engineers.
This contribution to the understanding of professional competency development can aide both academic stakeholders in the continued development of work-based curriculums and employers in fostering valuable professional development for students in their placements.

As discussed, this paper provides an insightful analysis of how work-based placements contribute to the development of professional competencies. While not offering ground-breaking discoveries, it effectively highlights the importance of work-based learning in aligning educational programs with industry needs. The limitations are acknowledged but could have been addressed more thoroughly, particularly in exploring why certain competencies were not as prevalent. Overall, the work lays a solid foundation for future research and practical improvements in curriculum design.
