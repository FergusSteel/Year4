- Academic research relies on surveys it shows what is and what is not known in a subject area
	- It is for analysing and critically evaluating previous work
	- Places your current work into that context to explain "they have not done this, and I am doing that"
	- Helps you to define the boundaries of the problem you are planning to work on
	- Identifies the gaps in the existing knowledge

- The "Dark Side" Purpose
	- Who are the key people in this subject area
	- Where do they publish?
	- What are common methods in this area?
	- How is a bad paper different from a good paper
	- How do they write their literature reviews?

- Finding related literature
	- Know your search terms
	- Know your subject libraries
		- ACM Digital Library and IEEE explore are best
			- Use google scholar after this
	- Look for criteria to determine papers worth reading (standing of publication venue, number of citations)


- Hints
	- The literature review in your work needs to make clear why you did your work and why you did it in the way you choce.
		- How is your work different from the work you reviews
		- Or How are you using what you reviewed to build upon it.
	- Think carefully about the structure
		- You want to get to your specific subject very quickly
		- BUT you might have to start broad and narrow in
		- Use appropriate subheadings
	- Can put a search strategy in literature review saying - where i went, what i priotises, what were my key terms, why did i review what i reviewed.
- Sometimes a diagram that shows an overview of review can be a good idea
- Be light on quotes, use your own words
- Start writing early.
