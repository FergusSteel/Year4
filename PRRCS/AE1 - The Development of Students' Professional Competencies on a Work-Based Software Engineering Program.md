### Abstract
- Competency is the knowledge, skills and professional dispositions that an an individual is required to demonstrate to be considered professionally competent.
- Introduces idea of work-based learning in computing science - apprenticeships or internships for example.
- This paper investigates how students who have taken a degree-level apprenticeship have developed their professional competencies
- Study based on 38 students experiences.
- UK standard  for professional engineering competence and commitment is the framework for the competencies in this paper.
- Communication and interpersonal skills and "knowledge and understanding and design and development systems" most commonly cited skills by students

### Introduction
- To become an incorporated engineer in the UK, there are five competence and commitment areas:
	- Knowledge and understanding
	- Design, development and solving engineering problems
	- Responsibility, management and leadership
	- Communication and interpersonal skills
	- Personal and professional commitment
- RQ clearly defined as:
	- How do students develop their professional competencies on a work-based software engineering degree program?
- Aims to contribute to the understanding of the developement of professional competencies in the context of students who undertake a work-based software engineering program. 
	- I.e. what competencies rae most apt to be developed by an apprentice, and which are less prevelant in the workplace.

### Methodology
- The conceptual framework used in the paper uses the five dimensions of the UK-Spec, for assessing professional computing competencies
- This is good as faculty membered are not expert practitioners in the tasks students complete in their workplace placements
- Uses student journal assignments from these placements as data, these journals provide evidence from students of how they developed preponderance of the competencies listed in the framework.
- Coding is done therefore, by the students a priori as they label the data for this (is this reliable?)
	- We are really examining the percieved competency of the student, is this valid?
		- Oh this is addressed in the limitations, well established paradigm they say - students also provide evidence so its chill.
### Results & Discussion
- quotes and quotes and quotes
### Conclusion & Future Work
- Are reported to have been developed should likely be what students feel they experiences
- But overall the paper displays what UK-Spec professional competencies are developed on a work-based SE degree program.
- "the findings here shed light on how/which competencies are developed" - hmm
- "The less frequently reported E2, E3, and E5 competencies address professional commitment to work environment safety, sustainability and social/ethical responsibility. Participants’ limited self-reports in these areas may indicate a gap between the education of computing professionals and the industry’s expectations of software engineers"
- Discusses potential causes for this limitation although I think that it is ignoring the ease of reporting something that obviously they improve on like their communication and technical skills. The development of professional conduct? is that as easy for students to self identify.
