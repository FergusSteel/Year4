### Abstract
- Competency is the knowledge, skills and professional dispositions that an an individual is required to demonstrate to be considered professionally competent.
- Introduces idea of work-based learning in computing science - apprenticeships or internships for example.
- This paper investigates how students who have taken a degree-level apprenticeship have developed their professional competencies
- Study based on 38 students experiences.
- UK standard  for professional engineering competence and commitment is the framework for the competencies in this paper.
- Communication and interpersonal skills and "knowledge and understanding and design and development systems" most commonly cited skills by students

### Introduction
- To become an incorporated engineer in the UK, there are five competence and commitment areas:
	- Knowledge and understanding
	- Design, development and solving engineering problems
	- Responsibility, management and leadership
	- Communication and interpersonal skills
	- Personal and professional commitment
- RQ clearly defined as:
	- How do students develop their professional competencies on a work-based software engineering degree program?
- Aims to contribute to the understanding of the developement of professional competencies in the context of students who undertake a work-based software engineering program. 
	- I.e. what competencies rae most apt to be developed by an apprentice, and which are less prevelant in the workplace.

### Methodology
- The conceptual framework used in the paper uses the five dimensions of the UK-Spec, for assessing professional computing competencies
- This is good as faculty membered are not expert practitioners in the tasks students complete in their workplace placements
- Uses student journal assignments from these placements as data, these journals provide evidence from students of how they developed preponderance of the competencies listed in the framework.
- Coding is done therefore, by the students a priori as they label the data for this (is this reliable?)
	- We are really examining the percieved competency of the student, is this valid?
		- Oh this is addressed in the limitations, well established paradigm they say - students also provide evidence so its chill.
### Results & Discussion
- quotes and quotes and quotes check pdf for notes
### Conclusion & Future Work
- Are reported to have been developed should likely be what students feel they experiences
- But overall the paper displays what UK-Spec professional competencies are developed on a work-based SE degree program.
- "the findings here shed light on how/which competencies are developed" - hmm
- "The less frequently reported E2, E3, and E5 competencies address professional commitment to work environment safety, sustainability and social/ethical responsibility. Participants’ limited self-reports in these areas may indicate a gap between the education of computing professionals and the industry’s expectations of software engineers"
- Discusses potential causes for this limitation although I think that it is ignoring the ease of reporting something that obviously they improve on like their communication and technical skills. The development of professional conduct? is that as easy for students to self identify.

**Review**

This paper investigates how students in work-based learning programs develop professional competencies during industry placements. Using established frameworks like the UK standard for accrediting Inc. Engineers (UK-Spec), it shows the need to integrate the development of these competencies into degree curriculum via work-based approaches to prepare students for work in  tech.

While the framework for identifying professional competencies is well established. This paper seeks to discuss _how_ & which professional competencies are developed when students undertake industry placements. The paper touches on the validity of the frameworks & their rationales through referencing other research into professional skills development. Approaching the problem from an angle of qualitative understanding of  student experience isn't a novel method for investigating the process by which students identify their own development of professional skills. However, framing it under a previously unstudied framework , is an important new angle to explore. Furthering the understanding of how to adapt work-based placements for training professionals.

This paper focuses on literature relevant to developing professional competencies in computing science. Referencing several pieces of literature about work-based learning and general professional skills development in competency-based computing curriculum. Using well established frameworks from reputable sources to discuss curriculum development (IT2017, CC2020) & for defining professional skills (UK-Spec). The paper uses evidence to motivate its methodology & justify the limitations of self-reported data, by referencing papers that use self-reported student experiences in computing literature. The paper also uses thorough citations to support the discussion of the results & to motivate future work.

The paper identifies the limitations of using one cohort and self-reported data. Surveying a single cohort is justifiable given the large sample size, and while self-reported data contains biases (e.g., students may misidentify characteristics), this is reduced by requiring peer-reviewed evidence from managers and instructors. To aid the depth of the research, students could have been asked to provide evidence for why they felt they **did not** develop certain competencies. This would increase the quantity of data collected, adding to the external validity, and it would also add valuable insight into understanding how certain competencies are developed and why other competencies are not developed.

The investigation is well presented and easy to follow, the codes used to identify professional competencies clearly explained. The quotes used in the results section are well selected and aid the discussion naturally.

This paper presents an insightful investigation into how professional competencies develop in students. Using a qualitative approach based on a established framework, the conclusions of how the cohort of students developed the outlined skills are valid and helpful in developing the current understanding of how work-based curriculums aid in equipping software engineers.
This contribution to the understanding of professional competency development can aide both academic stakeholders in the continued development of work-based curriculums and employers in fostering valuable professional development for students in their placements.

As discussed, this paper provides an insightful analysis of how work-based placements contribute to the development of professional competencies. While not offering ground-breaking discoveries, it effectively highlights the importance of work-based learning in aligning educational programs with industry needs. The limitations are acknowledged but could have been addressed more thoroughly, particularly in exploring why certain competencies were not as prevalent. Overall, the work lays a solid foundation for future research and practical improvements in curriculum design.


## Review Notes
```
She thinks, i can make my judgement stronger in the novelty part (p2)
Describving what they do is fine but I need to talk about a review HOW DO I FEEL p3
p4 is good
p5 no comments
p6 "ok"
p7 "ok"

Overall: Yeah reads well, needs more review in p2 and p3

This paper seeks to discuss _how_ & which professional competencies are developed when students undertake industry placements and bases this investigation in a well established framework for identifying professional competencies. The paper touches on the validity of the framework & their own rationales through referencing other research into professional skills development. Approaching the problem from an angle of qualitative understanding of student experience may not be a novel method for investigating how students identify their own development of professional skills. However, framing it under a previously unstudied framework , is an important novel angle to explore. Furthering the understanding of how to adapt work-based placements for training professionals.

This paper explores literature relevant to developing professional competencies in computing science. Referencing several key pieces of recent literature about work-based learning and general professional skills development in competency-based computing curriculum. Using well established frameworks from reputable sources to discuss curriculum development (IT2017, CC2020) & for defining professional skills (UK-Spec). The paper uses this evidence to thoroughly motivate its methodology & justify the limitations - adding both important context, and additional evidence-based support for its investigation. The paper also uses thorough citations to support the discussion of these results & to motivate future work.
