### Abstract
- Competency is the knowledge, skills and professional dispositions that an an individual is required to demonstrate to be considered professionally competent.
- Introduces idea of work-based learning in computing science - apprenticeships or internships for example.
- This paper investigates how students who have taken a degree-level apprenticeship have developed their professional competencies
- Study based on 38 students experiences.
- UK standard  for professional engineering competence and commitment is the framework for the competencies in this paper.
- Communication and interpersonal skills and "knowledge and understanding and design and development systems" most commonly cited skills by students

### Introduction
- To become an incorporated engineer in the UK, there are five competence and commitment areas:
	- Knowledge and understanding
	- Design, development and solving engineering problems
	- Responsibility, management and leadership
	- Communication and interpersonal skills
	- Personal and professional commitment
- RQ clearly defined as:
	- How do students develop their professional competencies on a work-based software engineering degree program?
- Aims to contribute to the understanding of the developement of professional competencies in the context of students who undertake a work-based software engineering program. 
	- I.e. what competencies rae most apt to be developed by an apprentice, and which are less prevelant in the workplace.

### Methodology
- The conceptual framework used in the paper uses the five dimensions of the UK-Spec, for assessing professional computing competencies
- This is good as faculty membered are not expert practitioners in the tasks students complete in their workplace placements
- Uses student journal assignments from these placements as data, these journals provide evidence from students of how they developed preponderance of the competencies listed in the framework.
- Coding is done therefore, by the students a priori as they label the data for this (is this reliable?)
	- We are really examining the percieved competency of the student, is this valid?
		- Oh this is addressed in the limitations, well established paradigm they say - students also provide evidence so its chill.
### Results & Discussion
- quotes and quotes and quotes
### Conclusion & Future Work
- Are reported to have been developed should likely be what students feel they experiences
- But overall the paper displays what UK-Spec professional competencies are developed on a work-based SE degree program.
- "the findings here shed light on how/which competencies are developed" - hmm
- "The less frequently reported E2, E3, and E5 competencies address professional commitment to work environment safety, sustainability and social/ethical responsibility. Participants’ limited self-reports in these areas may indicate a gap between the education of computing professionals and the industry’s expectations of software engineers"
- Discusses potential causes for this limitation although I think that it is ignoring the ease of reporting something that obviously they improve on like their communication and technical skills. The development of professional conduct? is that as easy for students to self identify.

**Review**

Summary of Work:
This literature outlines a qualitative evaluation of how students enrolled in work-based learning programmes develop characteristics of “Professional Competency” through their experience in work placements. The paper uses established frameworks for identifying professional competencies, based on pillars identified by reputable industry bodies. The UK standard for professional engineering competence and commitments, is outlined to acredit Incorporated Engineers in the UK. The importance of identifying how to install work-based competencies in degree-level curriculum is well established in the paper, and is identified as key for equipping students with the skills that are important for entering the technology industry.

Originality and Novelty of the Work:
While the framework for identifying professional competencies is well established. This paper seeks to understand _how_ (and which) professional competencies are developed when students undertake industry placements. The paper touches upon the validity of these frameworks, and their rationale through referencing other investigations into professional skills in computing educations, as in Kiesler and Thorbrügge, 2023. Approaching the problem from an angle of qualitative understanding of self-reported student experience, is not novel method for investigating the process by which students identify their own development of professional skills (Bowers et al., 2022). While not a new methodology, framing this work under a previously unutilised framework in the UK-Spec, is an important new angle to investigate. It assists academics in understanding how they can adapt Software Engineering programs to adhere to guidelines for training Incorporated Engineers.

Previous Work Reviewed:  
This paper focuses on literature relevant to the development of professional competencies in computing science. Referencing several pieces of literature about work-based learning and general professional skills development in competency-based computing curriculum. The paper uses well established frameworks from reputable organisations to discuss curriculum development (IT2017 report and the ACM/IEEE Computing Curriculum 2020) and for defining professional skills (UK-Spec). Additionally, the paper uses evidence to motivate its methodology and justify the limitations of self-reported data – by referencing other papers that use self-reported/journal-style student experiences in computing literature. The paper also uses thorough citations to support the discussion of their results in the conclusion section and to motivate future work.

Robustness of Work Presented:  
While the paper does identify the limitations of using a singular cohort, and only collecting self-reported data, the paper does not reason for why it has not addressed these limitations. The limitation of surveying only a singular cohort is justifiable for convenience reasons. However, given that the authors designed the methodology for students to self report their professional development, it seems that discussion into why the reports are limited to only what the student has identified in themselves. Firstly self-reported data has bias, and student’s may falsely misidentify or misreport characteristics. While this limitation is reduced by having the students provide evidence, the authors could have also had student provide evidence for why they felt they **did not** develop certain professional competencies. Not only would this increase the quantity of data collected, adding to the external validity, it would also increase the data for understanding of how characteristics developed which is the key discussion in this paper.

Presentation
The investigation is well presented and easy to follow, the codes used to identify professional competencies are well explained. The quotes used in the results section are well selected and aides the discussion in a natural manner.

Significance:  
This paper presents a valid and insightful investigation into how professional competencies are developed. By using a qualitative approach based on a established framework the conclusions on how the cohort of students developed the outlined skills are both valid, and helpful in developing the current understanding of how a work-based curriculum aides in creating professionally equipped computing scientists. However, as is touched upon in the conclusion of the paper, the findings do not advance this understanding. It also does not help to bridge the established lack of knowledge on why students struggle to report development of the lesser reported competencies (i.e. professional commitment to social and ethical responsibilities).

Overall Evaluation:  
Overall, this paper represents a valuable investigation into student experience on work-based placements. The results are well presented and can likely be used to motivate decisions in future curriculums. While the results do not represent a breakthrough in understanding the importance and nature of developing professional competencies - they strongly motivate further research into how components of the UK-Spec can be better investigated in the future, and how to improve the understanding of professional competency development.
