### Abstract
- Competency is the knowledge, skills and professional dispositions that an an individual is required to demonstrate to be considered professionally competent.
- Introduces idea of work-based learning in computing science - apprenticeships or internships for example.
- This paper investigates how students who have taken a degree-level apprenticeship have developed their professional competencies
- Study based on 38 students experiences.
- UK standard  for professional engineering competence and commitment is the framework for the competencies in this paper.
- Communication and interpersonal skills and "knowledge and understanding and design and development systems" most commonly cited skills by students

### Introduction
- To become an incorporated engineer in the UK, there are five competence and commitment areas:
	- Knowledge and understanding
	- Design, development and solving engineering problems
	- Responsibility, management and leadership
	- Communication and interpersonal skills
	- Personal and professional commitment
- RQ clearly defined as:
	- How do students develop their professional competencies on a work-based software engineering degree program?
- Aims to contribute to the understanding of the developement of professional competencies in the context of students who undertake a work-based software engineering program. 
	- I.e. what competencies rae most apt to be developed by an apprentice, and which are less prevelant in the workplace.

### Methodology
- The conceptual framework used in the paper uses the five dimensions of the UK-Spec, for assessing professional computing competencies
- This is good as faculty membered are not expert practitioners in the tasks students complete in their workplace placements
- Uses student journal assignments from these placements as data, these journals provide evidence from students of how they developed preponderance of the competencies listed in the framework.
- Coding is done therefore, by the students a priori as they label the data for this (is this reliable?)
	- We are really examining the percieved competency of the student, is this valid?
		- Oh this is addressed in the limitations, well established paradigm they say - students also provide evidence so its chill.
### Results & Discussion
- quotes and quotes and quotes
### Conclusion & Future Work
- Are reported to have been developed should likely be what students feel they experiences
- But overall the paper displays what UK-Spec professional competencies are developed on a work-based SE degree program.
- "the findings here shed light on how/which competencies are developed" - hmm
- "The less frequently reported E2, E3, and E5 competencies address professional commitment to work environment safety, sustainability and social/ethical responsibility. Participants’ limited self-reports in these areas may indicate a gap between the education of computing professionals and the industry’s expectations of software engineers"
- Discusses potential causes for this limitation although I think that it is ignoring the ease of reporting something that obviously they improve on like their communication and technical skills. The development of professional conduct? is that as easy for students to self identify.

**Review**

This paper qualitatively evaluates how students in work-based learning programs develop professional competencies during industry placements. Using established frameworks, such as the UK standard for accrediting Incorporated Engineers, the paper emphasizes the need to integrate the development of these competencies into degree-level curriculum through work-based approaches to prepare students for professional work in the technology sector.

While the framework for identifying professional competencies is well established. This paper seeks to understand _how_ (and which) professional competencies are developed when students undertake industry placements. The paper touches upon the validity of these frameworks, and their rationale through referencing other investigations into professional skills in computing educations, (Kiesler & Thorbrügge, 2023). Approaching the problem from an angle of qualitative understanding of self-reported student experience, is not a novel method for investigating the process by which students identify their own development of professional skills (Bowers et al., 2022). While not a new methodology, framing this work under a previously unutilised framework in the UK-Spec, is an important new angle to investigate. Assisting academics in understanding how they can adapt work-based placements to adhere to guidelines for training professionals.

This paper focuses on literature relevant to the development of professional competencies in computing science. Referencing several pieces of literature about work-based learning and general professional skills development in competency-based computing curriculum. The paper uses well established frameworks from reputable organisations to discuss curriculum development (IT2017 report, CC2020) and for defining professional skills (UK-Spec). Additionally, the paper uses evidence to motivate its methodology and justify the limitations of self-reported data – by referencing other papers that use self-reported/journal-style student experiences in computing literature. The paper also uses thorough citations to support the discussion of their results in the conclusion section and to motivate future work.

The paper suitably identifies the limitations of using a singular cohort, and only collecting self-reported data. The limitation of surveying only a singular cohort is justifiable for convenience reasons and the sample size is suitably large. Furthermore, self-reported data contains inherent biases, and student’s may potentially misidentify or misreport characteristics. However, this limitation is reduced by having the students provide evidence which is peer reviewed by their managers and instructors. To aide the depth of the research, the authors could have had students provide evidence for why they felt they **did not** develop certain professional competencies. Not only would this increase the quantity of data collected, adding to the external validity, it would also add valuable insight into  understanding how certain characteristics are developed or not developed, which is the key discussion in this paper.

The investigation is well presented and easy to follow, the codes used to identify professional competencies are well explained. The quotes used in the results section are well selected and aides the discussion in a natural manner.

This paper presents an insightful investigation into how professional competencies develop in students. By using a qualitative approach based on a established framework the conclusions on how the cohort of students developed the outlined skills are both valid, and helpful in developing the current understanding of how a work-based curriculum aides in creating professionally equipped computing scientists.
This papers contributes to the understanding of professional competency development and this can aide both academic stakeholders in the continued development of work-based curriculums and employers in fostering valuable professional development for students in their placements.

As discussed, this paper provides an insightful analysis of how work-based placements contribute to the development of professional competencies. While it doesn't offer ground-breaking discoveries, it effectively highlights the importance of work-based learning in aligning educational programs with industry needs. The study's limitations are acknowledged but could have been addressed more thoroughly, particularly in exploring why certain competencies were not as prevalent. Overall, the work lays a solid foundation for future research and practical improvements in curriculum design.
